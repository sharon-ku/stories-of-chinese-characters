### Description

*Stories of Chinese Characters* is an educational website that recounts the evolution of ancient pictograms to modern Chinese traditional characters. The illustrated visuals—combined with the storytelling format—shed light on the beauty behind the writing’s history. 

This project aims to spread knowledge of Chinese characters through a playful and joyful experience. As a second-generation immigrant who knows little about this topic, I am embarking on a personal journey to learn more about the Chinese culture through its language. By placing this information online, I hope to make it accessible to anyone else who is interested in this subject.
